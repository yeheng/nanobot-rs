//! Bootstrap helpers for embedding the engine in a host process.
//!
//! Per Linus review: the CLI was copy-pasting 6× the same six-line
//! "create broker → open sqlite → init globals" dance. Extracted here so the
//! call site shrinks to one line, and any future host (GUI, daemon, RPC)
//! gets the same initialization order for free.
//!
//! The helper deliberately stops short of unlocking the vault: vault unlock
//! is interactive (CLI prompts vs WebSocket handshake vs OAuth flow) and
//! belongs in the host crate, not in a generic bootstrap.
